# Image-Colorization-Using-GAN
Black and white image colorization using Generative Adversarial Network whrere Generator is attention skip-Unet and discriminator is patchGAN discriminator with custom loss

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for colorizing black-and-white images using the CelebA dataset. The model uses a U-Net generator with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and a PatchGAN discriminator, incorporating adversarial, pixel-wise, and perceptual losses.
